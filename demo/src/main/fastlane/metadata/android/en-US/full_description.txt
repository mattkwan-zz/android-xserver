This project implements an X11 server for use with Android devices, written in Java. The X11 server runs within an Android View subclass, allowing it to be embedded in other applications.

This is a fully functional and light-weight demo application.

To display programs within the X-Server app you need to set the DISPLAY environment variable on your host device. Its also highly recommended to use a window manager (i.e. <code>lwm</code>).
A simple window manager (FLWM) is already embedded into the application.

<pre>$ export DISPLAY=192.178.1.2:0
$ lwm &
$ xclock</pre>
